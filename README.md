## EVE Online API Clients
evelib is a library providing access to Eve Online's various APIs and Endpoints as well as Eve-Central's market API.

This library was originally forked from flexd/eveapi but it is not longer actively maintained. In an effort to continue development of the library as well as learn more about programming and school, I have forked it and wish to continue development.

Since I am comparatively new to programming (third year of uni at time of writing) and I am unfamiliar with source control, all contributions and constructive criticism is welcome!

This library might as well be pre-alpha, so trust nothing!

## Todo


* Implement the rest of the XML endpoints
* Complete refactoring
* Add CREST support
* Add Eve-Central Support
* Documentation?
* Tests for days
